# LI.FI - Types

Types for the LI.FI stack.

## Summary

This package contains all common types for the [LI.FI SDK](https://github.com/lifinance/sdk).
Learn more about LI.FI on (https://li.fi).

Check out the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the last releases.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @lifi/types
```

or

```bash
npm install --save @lifi/types
```

## Release

The package uses `standard-version` to generate a changelog based on semantic commit history. The `standard-version` package also handles version numbering.

Once main is up to date with the changes to be released execute the following command on the main branch to invoke `standard-version`:

```bash
yarn release
```

Then to release:

```bash
git push --follow-tags origin main
```

This will push a newly created git tag to the remote repository, which will trigger a github action which will publish the new version to npm
