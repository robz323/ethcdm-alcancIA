## Development Workflow

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the SDK.

### Pre-requisites: <!-- omit in toc -->

- Node.js: >= v20. See [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
- pnpm: v9.1.2. See [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions, you can run:

```bash
nvm use
```

to switch to the correct Node.js version.

We recommend to have [corepack](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-use-corepack) enabled to automatically have the correct version of `pnpm`.

### Initial Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lens-network/sdk.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Create `.env` file from the `.env.example` template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and populate the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable:

```bash filename=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY=0xâ€¦
```

with the private key of an account with Lens Network tokens.

> [!TIP]
> Ask the Lens Team for some $GRASS tokens and then [bridge](https://portal.staging.lens.zksync.dev/bridge) them to the Lens Network.
